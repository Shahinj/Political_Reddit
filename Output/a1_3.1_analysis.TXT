order from worst to best accuracy: SGDClassifier,GaussianNB,RandomForestClassifier,MLPClassifier,AdaBoostClassifier

Makes sense, since the last 3 are far more complex algorithms than the original ones.
We expect AdaBoostClassifier to be better than RandomForestClassifier, because it is basically a more complicated RandomForestClassifier.
Same with MLPClassifier and GaussianNB, since in MLPClassifier, we can learn the weights of the words better.
The confusion matrix for GaussianNB is suggesting that the model is dominantly predicting class 2, which is problematic.
Overall, the accuracies are not that great, and we are slightly above random chance (25%).
