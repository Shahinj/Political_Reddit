Chosen feature intersection: [  2  83  96 149]
2: Number of first-person pronouns
83: liwc_money
96: liwc_quant
149: receptiviti_insecure

These features indicate that most of comments processed are probably about money and how different parties argue around it.
For example, one of the main political debates is about how much should be invested in different sectors, such as environmental issues
and how much does that affect the economy. The first-person pronouns and receptiviti_insecure can also be an indication of how individuals
argue about their issues and experiences and they make a point that the money should be invested on those problems.


P-values all ended up being zero after rounding, so we cannot make a statement here. However, generally, I expect the p-values to be 
higher when we have more data, since it is easier to find features that are very specific to a class when there is small set of data.

11:  Number of proper nouns

Again, same explanation as mentioned for part a. The number of proper nouns is an indication on special events, people and issues.
This makes sense, since again in politcal discussions, people refer to specific events, and specific person's government.
